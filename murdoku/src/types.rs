//! Domain types and invariants for the Murdoku puzzle game contract.

/*
INVARIANTS:
1. A valid grid has exactly grid_size * grid_size cells.
2. A valid solution has exactly one occurrence of each suspect index (1..=N) per row and per column.
3. ClueType::MustBeInCell requires both row and col to be set; adjacency clues require two suspect IDs.
4. Grid size must be 4 or 5 for v1; reject other values at submit time (enforced in the registry issue).
